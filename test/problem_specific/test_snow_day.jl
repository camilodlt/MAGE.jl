Text from paper: 

Given an integer representing a number
of hours and 3 ï¬‚oats representing how much snow is on the
ground, the rate of snow fall, and the proportion of snow
melting per hour, return the amount of snow on the ground
after the amount of hours given. Each hour is considered a
discrete event of adding snow and then melting, not a con-
tinuous process.
