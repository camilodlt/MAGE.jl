```{julia}
#| eval: false
decode_with_output_node(
    ut_genome::UTGenome,
    output_node::OutputNode,
    meta_library::MetaLibrary,
    model_architecture::modelArchitecture,
    shared_inputs::SharedInput,
)::Program

```

Decodes a single program, that is, the sequence of `Operation`s needed to calculate the output value of a single output node.
 
Returns a `Program`, which is a series of operations (from last to first) and holds a `SharedInput` reference which can be modified in order to change the inputs for the program without decoding again.
