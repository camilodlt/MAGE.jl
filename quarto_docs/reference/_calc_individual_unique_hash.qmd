```{julia}
#| eval: false
_calc_individual_unique_hash(
    extra_hashes::OrderedDict{String,Vector{T}},
    index_at::Int,
) where {T}

```

The `id_hash` is the sha256 of the union of all hashes for a given individual at position `index_at`.
 
Example :
 
The `column_view` has 2 keys "hash1" and "hash2". There are 2 individuals hashed. {     "hash1" => ["a","b"]     "hash2" => ["1", "2"] }
 
For `index_at` of 1, it will perform the sha algorithm of ["a", "1"], and for an `index_at` of 2, it will perform the hashing on ["b","2"].
