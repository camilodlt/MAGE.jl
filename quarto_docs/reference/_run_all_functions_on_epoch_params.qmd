```

The `writer` has a bunch of hash function, for each column in the DB. Some functions will provide information for each edge (i.e. `edges_prop_getters`) and some will provide information (a hash) for each node (i.e. `nodes_hashers`). 
 
This function executes all functions with the epoch `params` as input (either for edges or for nodes). It  is up to the hash function to know which information it hashes. And, it is up to the caller to modify the `params` if needed (selecting only the elite for example).
 
The function returns a column view which is an OrderedDict with :     - keys : the keys in the `writer`     - values : A vector with the hashed values (or properties) for all individuals
