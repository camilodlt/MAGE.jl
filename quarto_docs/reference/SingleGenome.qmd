```{julia}
#| eval: false
SingleGenome(starting_point::Int, chromosome::Vector{<:AbstractEvolvableNode})

```

A SingleGenome is like an standard CGP vector representation. It holds a vector of nodes.
 
Also it has an `starting_point`, indicating that the first node has a `x_position` of `starting_point+1`. The `starting_point` hence represents the number of inputs that should precede the genome.
 
It is supposed to reference functions that return only one defined type.
