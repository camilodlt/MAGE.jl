# _assert_sn_writer_consistency {#sec-doc}
    

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="docblock" collapse=false}    


```{julia}
#| eval: false
_assert_sn_writer_consistency(con, hashers)

```

Checks that the `hashers` dict has:     - The nb of functions == the number of cols that need a function (so no the mandatory ones)      - Keys that match the names and order of the columns in the corresponding table in `con`     - The table : sn.Abstract*Edges, Abstract*Nodes
 
In other words, that the `hashers` have an item for all the columns in the table and also in the correct order. 
 
This function raises an AssertionError if the conditions are not met.

If there are no fns, the functions does nothing. It has nothing to verify
