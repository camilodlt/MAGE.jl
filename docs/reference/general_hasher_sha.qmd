```{julia}
#| eval: false
general_hasher_sha(element::T) where {T}

```

Serializes an element and then calculates the SHA256 of that serialization value.  The hash is then transformed to hex values to make it shorter. 
 
An hash, in the form of an string, is returned. 
 
This method may be used to hash every element in the package.  Also, it should be session persistent.
