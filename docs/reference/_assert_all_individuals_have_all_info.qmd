::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="docblock" collapse=false}    


```{julia}
#| eval: false
_assert_all_individuals_have_all_info(extra_hashes::OrderedDict{String,Any})

```

Because extractor functions work on batch data, after applying them we have : 
 
A dict with :      - Keys : the col names in the DB     - Values : A vector with hashes/properties for each individual
 
This is the column view. 
 
All vectors should have the same length. Because for each function, it should  have hashed all individuals. 
 
As an example, suppose      - hasher1 gives the length of the individual     - hasher2 gives the length of the active individual
 
If the population has 3 individuals. 
 
  * The `column_view` dict should have 2 entries (names should match the DB) : `hasher1`, `hasher2`.
  * Each entry is a vector of length 3. One for every individual
This functions just ensures that all keys have vectors of the same length.
