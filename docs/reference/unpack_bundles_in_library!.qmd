# unpack_bundles_in_library! {#sec-doc}
    

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="docblock" collapse=false}    

From all the bundles in the Library, it *unpacks* them and adds ALL functions to the internal list of functions.
 
It's a way of having all functions (comming from multiple bundles) in the same place. 
 
This operation is meant to be run once, after all bundles have been added to the Library.
 
**Caveats**: 
 
  * This functions will replace the previous (if any) content of the internal list of fns
of the Library. A warning is given if the list of functions was not empty.
 
  * A warning is also given if the bundles, after unpacking, resulted in an empty list of functions.
Returns the number of functions in Library (after unpacking).
