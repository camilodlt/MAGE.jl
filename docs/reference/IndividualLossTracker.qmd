# IndividualLossTracker {#sec-doc}
    

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="docblock" collapse=false}    

individual i : [loss*x*1, loss*x*2, ..., loss*x*n] where n is the number of samples in the data.
 
In words: each individual has a fitness value for every data sample.
 
During inference steps, the method `add_pop_loss_to_ind_tracker` adds losses to the store.     => so that each ind_i = [numbers]
 
Before elite selection, the method `resolves_ind_loss_tracker` takes the mean per individual.     => so that each ind_i = number
