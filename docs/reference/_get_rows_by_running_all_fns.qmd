# _get_rows_by_running_all_fns {#sec-doc}
    

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="docblock" collapse=false}    


```{julia}
#| eval: false
function _get_rows_by_running_all_fns(
    params::UTCGP.ParametersStandardEpoch,
    writer::Abstract_SN_Writer,
)

```

Runs the functions (either node/edge) against the epoch parameters. 
 
Those functions return a column view (col_name => [population info, ...])
 
That column view is transposed to have a row view:      - {col=> value, ...}  # row 1 relative to individual 1
 
For `sn.Abstract_Nodes`, the `id_hash` will be calculated and placed at the beginning of the row.
