# get_active_node_material {#sec-doc}
    

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="docblock" collapse=false}    


```{julia}
#| eval: false
get_active_node_material(
    node::AbstractEvolvableNode,
    library::Library,
    ut_genome::UTGenome,
    shared_inputs::SharedInput,
    model_architecture::modelArchitecture,
)

```

Returns a vector of integers of the actual used pointers in the node. 
 
A function is always used, so the first element in the vector will be the index of the function.  Then, for each input that the function uses, the index (horizontal) of the input and the type index (vertical) are appended to the vector. 
 
One exception concerns the direct connexion to an input node (on in `shared_inputs`), in that case, only the index (horizontal) is appended since its type index is resolved dynamically. 
 
This fn will raise an error if the node does not work, so it's better to use it after an if shorcircuit.
