```{julia}
#| eval: false
where_to_mutate(length_::Int, threshold::Float64, rng::AbstractRNG)

```

This functions samples from [0:1] `length_` times. Each sampled number is compared against a `threshold`.
 
**Example**
 
For a `threshold` of 0.4 and a `length_` of 10, it will, on average, return a vector  with 6 0s and 4 1s.  
 
**Caveats**
 
  * `length_` >= 1
**Returns** a Bool Vector telling whether or not the sampled number was less or equal  than the threshold.
