Library(bundles::Vector{FunctionBundle})

```

Creates a library adding all function bundles. 
 
The vector of FunctionBundles is `deepcopy`ed so that changes to that vector  don't affect the Library. 
 
The internal library of FunctionWrappers is empty.

A Library Holds ALL functions that return a 'type' for UTCGP
 
Callable functions come in bundles of FunctionWrappers.
 
So the Library first store the bundles and then unpacks them to create the internal library.
