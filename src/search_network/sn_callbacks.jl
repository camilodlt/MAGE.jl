SN Writer is an struct who will be responsible for the Search Network callbacks. 

This SN Writer is meant to store all the individuals in the population, that population is not
filtered in any way.

It accepts :
    - A function that returns the index of the edges relative to the population 
    - The functions that will hash the individuals
    - The functions that will provide information for the edges

See the call to the instantiation of this struct for more information

The instantiated SN_writer writes : 
- The nodes 
- The edges between the parent and all the children

Hashes will depend on which hashers where passed to the SN_writer during initialization. 

All individuals are hashed with those hashers. 

Edges happen between the `id_hash` of the parent and that of every child. 
Extra cols for the EDGE table depend on the `edges_prop_getters` of the struct. 

Note: `id_hash` is the hash of the union of all extra hashes.
